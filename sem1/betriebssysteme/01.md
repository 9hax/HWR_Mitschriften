## Basics

The basis of operating systems are drivers, which allow the kernel to communicate with the underlying hardware.

Bus systems are used to share data between multiple bus user devices.

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is used to compute machine code. There are different architectures used to encode different instructions. 
These include architectures like amd64, arm and x86.

RAM (Random Access Memory) is a fast type of memory which can be used way faster than typical storage. 
The registers and cache usually live within the CPU, while the main memory is in external modules contained on the motherboard.

## Processes

The appearant "multitasking" of a single core CPU is an illusion that is created by task scheduling.
This task scheduling is done by the OS.

Processes are organized in a tree structure and are created by forking a parent process and then loading new code into the rocess which is then executed.
If a parent process is terminated or dies, child processes die aswell.

## Threads

Threads are used to split up the resources of a single process (code, data, fileIO) to be used by multiple operations taking part on multiple cpu cores (if possible) and thus be executed in parallel.
